* 
* RSA.js is a suite of routines for performing RSA public-key computations
* in JavaScript.  The cryptographic functions herein are used for encoding
* and decoding strings to be sent over unsecure channels.
*
* To use these routines, a pair of public/private keys is created through a
* number of means (OpenSSL tools on Linux/Unix, Dave Shapiro's
* RSAKeyGenerator program on Windows).  These keys are passed to RSAKeyPair
* as hexadecimal strings to create an encryption key object.  This key object
* is then used with encryptedString to encrypt blocks of plaintext using the
* public key.  The resulting cyphertext blocks can be decrypted with
* decryptedString.
*
* Note that the cryptographic functions herein are complementary to those
* found in CryptoFuncs.php and CryptoFuncs.pm.  Hence, encrypted messages may
* be sent between programs written in any of those languages.  The most
* useful, of course is to send messages encrypted by a Web page using RSA.js
* to a PHP or Perl script running on a Web servitron.
*
* Also, the optional padding flag may be specified on the call to
* encryptedString, in which case blocks of cyphertext that are compatible
* with real crypto libraries such as OpenSSL or Microsoft will be created.
* These blocks of cyphertext can then be sent to Web servitron that uses one
* of these crypto libraries for decryption.  This allows messages encrypted
* with longer keys to be decrypted quickly on the Web server as well as
* making for more secure communications when a padding algorithm such as
* PKCS1v1.5 is used.
*
* These routines require BigInt.js and Barrett.js.

*
* 2014 Jan 11  E. Wilde       Add optional padding flag to encryptedString
*                             for compatibility with real crypto libraries
*                             such as OpenSSL or Microsoft.  Add PKCS1v1.5
*                             padding.
*
* 2015 Jan 5  D. Shapiro      Add optional encoding flag for encryptedString
*                             and encapsulate padding and encoding constants
*                             in RSAAPP object.

// IMPORTANT THING: Be sure to set maxDigits according to your precision

//
// Tweaked by Ian Bunning
// Alterations:
// Fix bug in function biFromHex(s) to allow
// parsing of strings of length != 0 (mod 4)

// Changes made by Dave Shapiro as of 12/30/2004:
//
// The BigInt() constructor doesn't take a string anymore. If you want to
// create a BigInt from a string, use biFromDecimal() for base-10
// representations, biFromHex() for base-16 representations, or
// biFromString() for base-2-to-36 representations.
//
// biFromArray() has been removed. Use biCopy() instead, passing a BigInt
// instead of an array.
//
// The BigInt() constructor now only constructs a zeroed-out array.
// Alternatively, if you pass <true>, it won't construct any array. See the
// biCopy() method for an example of this.
//
// Be sure to set maxDigits depending on your precision needs. The default
// zeroed-out array ZERO_ARRAY is constructed inside the setMaxDigits()
// function. So use this function to set the variable. DON'T JUST SET THE
// VALUE. USE THE FUNCTION.
//
// ZERO_ARRAY exists to hopefully speed up construction of BigInts(). By
// precalculating the zero array, we can just use slice(0) to make copies of
// it. Presumably this calls faster native code, as opposed to setting the
// elements one at a time. I have not done any timing tests to verify this
// claim.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
